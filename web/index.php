        <p id="info">My name is Scott Tolman. I am a Software Engineering major. I do school full-time and don't currently work outside
                the house. I have 6 kids ages 7, 7, 5, 3, 0, and 0. I don't really know what I am interested in because I haven't
                had time to figure that out with all these kids. <code>I do enjoy programming though.</code></p>
